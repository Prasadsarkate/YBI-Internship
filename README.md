# YBI Foundation Internship Project 🚀

This repository contains the complete project report and source code for my internship at **YBI Foundation**. The project focuses on Data Science and Machine Learning to solve a real-world predictive modeling problem.

## 📋 Project Overview

* **Internship Provider:** YBI Foundation
* **Domain:** Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning / Data Science
* **Project Title:** [Insert Project Name Here, e.g., Big Sales Prediction]
* **Goal:** To build a machine learning model that predicts [Target Variable] based on various input features.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The project is structured into chapters effectively documenting the entire workflow:

* **Chapter 1 : Table of Content** - Outline of the project.
* **Chapter 2 : Introduction** - Overview of the problem statement and objectives.
* **Chapter 3 : Approach** - Methodology and steps taken to solve the problem.
* **Chapter 4 : Data Description** - Details about the dataset, features, and preprocessing.
* **Chapter 5 : Modelling** - Machine Learning algorithms used, training, and testing.
* **Chapter 6 : Results** - Model performance, accuracy scores, and visualizations.
* **Chapter 7 : Suggestions & Future Scope** - Conclusion and potential improvements.
* **Chapter 8 : About Us** - Information about the internship context.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
* **Libraries:**
    * `Pandas` (Data Manipulation)
    * `NumPy` (Numerical Computations)
    * `Matplotlib` / `Seaborn` (Data Visualization)
    * `Scikit-Learn` (Machine Learning Models)

## 📊 Key Steps Performed

1.  **Data Collection:** Imported dataset from YBI Foundation source.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized correlations and distributions.
4.  **Model Selection:** Tested algorithms like [Mention Models, e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest].
5.  **Evaluation:** Measured performance using metrics like Accuracy, MSE, or R2 Score.

## 📈 Results

* **Best Model:** [Name of Best Model, e.g., Random Forest Regressor]
* **Accuracy/Score:** [Insert Score, e.g., 85%]

> The model successfully captures the patterns in the data and provides reliable predictions for the target variable.
